run npm init in your project to add node as your package manager, it will ask multiple ques such as pkg name etc
once npm is initialised, we will add bundler to the app- this will compress n bundle all our files together into a package eg webpack, veet, parcel
using parcel for now, install it using, npm i -D parcel (-D to specify this is dev dependency )
dependencies- dev dependency(reqd only in dev phase) and normal(used in prod)
